# ComputerCraft-Decavestion
A ComputerCraft project that uses Turtles to mine massive chunks of material. A command turtle is used to control, deploy, and collect each individual mining turtle. Shulkers can be used to increase destruction.

CURRENTLY BROKEN. Being updated to run better and fit current Minecraft blocks/entities.
