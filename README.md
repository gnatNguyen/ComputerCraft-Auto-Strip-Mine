# The ultimate semi-auto cave decimator
**CURRENTLY WORKING**
**Still work in progress**

A ComputerCraft project that uses Turtles to mine massive chunks of material. A command turtle is used to control, deploy, and collect each individual mining turtle. Shulkers can be used to increase destruction.
*How to use*
When run, user will be prompted for number of turtles to deploy and whether to use shulkers.
Command turtle needs to have a disk drive and floppy disk and needs to be placed on top of a chest.
A cobblestone block is used to mark wall to start mining.
